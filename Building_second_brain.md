To organize our notes we should relate them with a project
in which we are gonna take action instead of complicated hierarchies to archive data

When taking notes we should ask ourselves how that note
is going to help our future self, taking in consideration
we should summarize the main ideas to later reconstruct what
the article or books was about

I am still exceptive that for all people applies that
taking action is necessary and maybe I am a special case
in which I can learn by theory instead of experience.
I think that systemic organized knowledge surpass experience.
But lets experiment and challenge that vision of mine.
