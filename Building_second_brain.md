The superpowers of a Second Brain
- Making our ideas concrete
- Revealing new associations between ideas
- Incubating ideas over time 
- Sharpening our unique perspectives

page 34
We have a bias called recency bias in which we favor recent
data, even if it is not the best (notes needed)

Ideas and creativity needs time to incubate

page 36
It appears that jobs that need decision making 
are resilient towards automatization(notes needed)

Our careers and businesses are about persuading others

Sebastian Junger stated that creative blocking
is a consequence of the lack of more data and deeper knowledge
to articulate with (notes needed)

CODE

- Capture: Keep what resonates
- Organize: Save for actionability
- Distill: Find the essence
- Express: Show your work


Page 43
What resonates could be differentiate by instinct and not
to much reflection

To organize our notes we should relate them with a project
in which we are gonna take action instead of complicated hierarchies to archive data

When taking notes we should ask ourselves how that note
is going to help our future self, taking in consideration
we should summarize the main ideas to later reconstruct what
the article or books was about

As en example of synthesis there is the E=mc2 Einstein's 
equation.

Page 44
I am still exceptive that for all people applies that
taking action is necessary and maybe I am a special case
in which I can learn by theory instead of experience.
I think that systemic organized knowledge surpass experience.
But lets experiment and challenge that vision of mine.

Check: Erwin Raphael McManus, The Artisan Soul: Crafting Your Life into a Work of Art (New York: HarperCollins, 2014), 171.

I remember creating a complete react builder to use in liferay as free marker 
templates for client side rendering, this allowed me to create
instead of consuming theory, there are some facts that support
that our inner selfs are delighted by creation and manipulation.

But how to transmit this information? that is another way to 
apply the knowledge, but is difficult because of the
curse of knowledge. For instance a trainee level programmer
is going to feel overwhelmed by my builder project.

From the enterprise perspective I think we should consider 
- Knowledge management
- Automatization
- High level correct abstractions

What about education? each person has different motivations,
knowledge levels, etc. What matters the most for them to make
information an actionable asset is not the same. How can we
customize their experience?

Where does come the approach of adapting ourselves to the rest and
not empowering personalization come from? Maybe IA can help us fill
this gap and make customized experiences of learning. 

Some universities have this concept of free university services
like one to one sessions, but I think it is too late to start
personalization and it should start in classrooms.

Creativity takes time to incubate so my father advice to study in
advance is gold.

May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology indicates that the human brain remembers information using a “grid code”—a part of the brain involved in spatial reasoning. They speculate that “the grid code could therefore be some sort of metric or coordinate system” that can “uniquely and efficiently represent a lot of information.

Page 47

Knowledge Garden is an interesting concept

Why is that some constructs and abstractions seemed dull to me but
now that I have and explanation for them I can use them as tools?
(Skepticism bias)

Page 48

I like Swift's note sharing because I think I can extrapolate that to work
and studies. For instance to have a topic, use a Miro Board or Mural
and make students to share what they think about it before the class 
and after too, when it grows too much we can start slicing it and 
creating a new subtopic board.

Now to think about it that is why in agile they like to have real 
time boards to collaborate and give feedback.

Page 49
Creative process is important, we should investigate about it.

Page 50
We should expand our notion of knowledge.

I remember a passage of some book about software architecture or 
maybe about documentation that said that documentation
could be found in chains of emails, which seemed hilarious to me at first
but is true. But it emphasizes that is not a good way to put
the documentation.

I remember that I know a lot of things because of southpark

Page 52

Whe should not keep in our second brain:

Sensitive information
Big or specialized files
Collaborative edition


Maybe we can talk about a collective brain (Remember the Borg collective)

Page 53

I admire Feynman, I should investigate his life and take inspiration
I admire Carl Sagan too

Feynman had a list of his 12 principal problems at the moment (and in his
brain too) and when new knowledge or info came across him, he tested if 
that info fits in any problem


Page 55

It states that the frame of questions can change, but this is 
counterintuitive with the idea of avoiding goal creeping

So I thinks this is to enrich knowledge by accident, that is
why these are open ended questions, this are aside the 
goals to avoid procrastination.

It is kind of curios or even paradoxical that one of the open
problems is how to avoid procrastination

It was key to question me what obsessed me as a kid to find
this questions

page 57

Criteria to capture:
- Does it inspire me?
- Is it useful?
- Is it personal?
- Is it surprising?

When reading about is it personal y remembered my mother is aging
and have not been a very good son

I should revisit Shannon information theory

Shannon apparently define information as something that surprises you

I remember novelty is and evolutionary advantage

Social media already uses its algorithms to feed us
with what we like the most

There is a contradiction between the confirmation bias
and the evolutionary advantage of
novelty

I remember now that when someone says
something different to what I believe
I learn more because I make y
best effort to prove them wrong.

Should expand the criteria list a bit more.

Should create a color system according to criteria

Should create maybe a special language like RFC do.

I think I should create a meme about the 4 criteria


Page 59

Emotion apparently organizes rather than disrupting

But I know that emotion needs to be regulated as well, I need more
info about both approaches

The reference about emotions as
and organization force is called
the science behind  inside out (the movie)
which has a payment wall beyond the new york times, but not long ago I was sharing with my
classmates that the university email opens to us
benefits and discounts and someone
asked where can I see more of those
benefits and to answer him I started googling
and found that NY times has discount for students. Wonderful coincidence.

there is a book I should read "Designing for Behavior Change"

The authors’ conclusion: “Our intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without our conscious awareness.”

It is important for me that this  challenges
my preconception of emotions regulation. Gabriela not long ago told me to listen to
my intuition and was thinking something like
that is too hippy, but now I have to reconsider it.

Study about the generation effect, which makes more feasible
to remember something if we externalize it
by writing or similar

Writing about Emotional Experiences as a Therapeutic Process,” Psychological Science 8, no. 3 (May 1997), 162– 66.

Should create a meme about the relative loop
like I know that something bothers me because I need
to remember it but I forget because I need to remember to remember

Perhaps the most immediate benefit of capturing content outside our heads is that we escape what I call the “reactivity loop”—the hamster wheel of urgency, outrage, and sensationalism that characterizes so much of the Internet. The moment you first encounter an idea is the worst time to decide what it means. You need to set it aside and gain some objectivity.

I find very useful that paper
about writing as an improving force, because apparently
it boosters our self care and immune system

Should clean the second brain with revisit, like
cleaning a garden.

I think to revisit and clean up the second brain is useful as a tip for students

I think something like that is applicable to
checking my work as a developer, eve a checklist is
time consuming and stressful, is better than rely on my memory.


I think in my job a s front end developer
is applicable that intuition we were talking about too when revisit my job

I think that intuition could be trained with inf
and info could be enriched by intuition and emotions
so is kind of a feedback loop

I remember asking myself about the difference of playing
a musical instrument or musical piece
just by ear from playing reading a musical
sheet, I related here this because
the key of my question is the intuition as a force for
interpretation and I wonder
how we lost the intuition when we mechanically
sing the notes in pour brain before playing them instead of not knowing
he name but just the sound and he muscular memory for it

This relates to me with the ultra instinct
from Dragon Ball which not long ago
I related with the flow mode and the study 
aside from distractions, the egoist doctrine
and how some philosophers stated that we should contemplate
and study for doing so and not with a goal in mind.

Perhaps reading and learning and note taking and
making abstractions could be done like the
the ultra instinct

Externalizing info and writing is powerful
This is called “detachment gain,” as explained in The Detachment Gain: The Advantage of Thinking Out Loud by Daniel Reisberg


I find that using chat gpt as a companion for this things is wonderful, I mean externalizing and curating the content

I asked chatgpt about more resources and popped out
atomic habits, I think this is related with my 12 problems specifically about how to booster info transmission in trainees and undergraduates

There is this technique ins software development called rubber duck debugging which I thinks is related to externalizing the info

Page 67

I think we need to feel the sensation of commitment to be more productive
I think I should investigate more about this

IN my job with the planning I don't feel committed because the data is already there
and I dint have tome to reflect

Dance might seem like the creative medium that could least benefit from “organizing.” It is performed live each time, using primarily the dancers’ own bodies, and often seems improvisational and spontaneous. Yet in her (T wyla Tharp)book The Creative Habit 

Reading the method of Twyla it reminds me the ability of my mother to organize things and remember it, like a system
because Twyla does something similar in her box, s not just tossed around but organized physically.

I need to talk with my mom about her system.

I remembered about techniques of interview as a tool for elicitation, one of them was conducted interviews

I remembered that since little my intuition often told me (via emotions) that I am not
understanding something because is not organized, like I don't have mental model for it yet and feel the sensation to not know hot to start

Talking about intuition I think this is called notion, and has to be built
and is an important part o creating mental models. Like the notion of set
This popped ou while talking with Ruben about the translation in spanish
of student record

Page 68

Twyla anecdote about the open idea of Billy Idols project prove me several things

- Knowledge come in form of anecdotes too, but are not scientific evidence, be careful (should investigate about intuition vs formalization)(should investigate or remember about how two ideas are not actually diatomic but part of the same process)

- Even open ideas must be organized
= I was looking for a reconciliation with goals and open ideas and it seems a good starting oint how she with her box method organize and open idea, because he idea is the goal itself, but I need to revisit that because I think I am
confusing the concept fo goal vs objective

But my intuition tells me that open ideas don't have clear goals and
in time they start taking shape, and from there some projects
more tangible and scoped could be born, so its like they part of
the creative process.

But this should be revisited because apparently she did not change her original goals but changed and adjusted other things so I think
there are parts of the process and projects that can be tunned without
sacrifice the goal.

I remember learning about goal creeping and that there differences about goals and objectives in the new science of learning

There they talked about SMART goals, specific, measurable, Achievable, Relevant and time bound, should revisit it an architect a connection here

I remember a chapter of the mentalist about the palace of memory I think is
related with the box method of her.

It is important to notice that we can backtrack process too wit this box, I thinks is important to gain insights
and backtrack process in order to reflect

This relates with meta cognition too, the feedback
meta reflecting we do 

We don’t need complex, sophisticated systems to be able to produce complex, sophisticated works.

I think I like complexity and should start
focusing on the other way,
start simple and producing complex
maintainable artifacts, like compilers do
