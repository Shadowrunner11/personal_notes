I am very interested about mete cognition and meta

I remember asking myself about the difference of playing
a musical instrument or musical piece
just by ear from playing reading a musical
sheet, I related here this because
the key of my question is the intuition as a force for
interpretation and I wonder
how we lost the intuition when we mechanically
sing the notes in pour brain before playing them instead of not knowing
he name but just the sound and he muscular memory for it

This relates to me with the ultra instinct
from Dragon Ball which not long ago
I related with the flow mode and the study 
aside from distractions, the egoist doctrine
and how some philosophers stated that we should contemplate
and study for doing so and not with a goal in mind.
